## SOLAR BEATS

`netlify functions:serve` will launch serverless function dev server

 use `netlify dev` to launch netlify dev server a.k.a. don't use `npm run start`

 sometimes netlify dev will say something like "process already running on 3000" and then crash, 
 in this case use `killall node` to kill the node process on 3000

 TODO: running into error: `URIError: URI malformed` it's crashing after clicking the Get Likes button

 TODO: scroll to bottom works but takes long time ( ~10 min )
